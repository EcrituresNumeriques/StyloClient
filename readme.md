# Stylo

This is a fork of [Lens](https://github.com/substance/lens), developed by [Substance](http://substance.io). It comes with a Writer component for web-based authoring and a new Reader component for displaying of scientific content.

This program is aimed to help social scientist to publish paper in a friendly yet very expressive way. It is based on top of lens Writer (which is built on top of substance). We are in the early alpha phase, this is not yet a stable software. Do not use in an actual publication workflow yet please.
