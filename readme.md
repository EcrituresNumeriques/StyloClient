# StyloClient

This program is aimed to help social scientist to publish paper in a friendly yet very expressive way. It is based on top of lens Writer (which is built on top of substance). We are in the early alpha phase, this is not yet a stable software. Do not use in an actual publication workflow yet please.


## How to install

The /bin folder will contain all the versions of the binaries you'll need. The nomenclature is the following XX.YY.ZZ 
- ZZ is the revision, or bug correction
- YY is the subversion, adding new features
- XX is the version, breaking compatibility with previous ones.

Select the version you want to install (usually the latest is the best choice), and then the platform (linux/mac/windows). This will contain everything you need to get started.
